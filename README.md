# DataMiningKnime-Classification
This course introduces concepts and methods of Data Mining with specific reference to Classification. In particular, the course will provide the following general concepts; data type, summarization, missing data replacement, and data pre-processing. Classification will be introduced together with the following concepts; explanatory and class attribute, train and test data set, classifier (learner and inducer), performance measures (accuracy, error, precision and recall), k-folds cross validation, overfitting and underfitting, curse of dimensionality, cost matrix, receiver operating characteristic curve, lift and cumulative gains charts, not relevant/redundant attributes, and features selection. The following classification models are described; decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, multi layer perceptron, naïve Bayes, tree augmented naïve Bayes and Bayesian classifiers. The course is self-contained as much as possible, and it does not require any programming skills. Indeed, the KNIME open source software platform, which exploits the concept of graphical workflow, is used to mine datasets consisting of different data types.
